Default glastopf site
=====================

The webpage hosted by the target system is using the standard source of content for glastopf.

This can make it easy to detect by the bad guys.

You can find the .txt file that is used for generating the page content and replace it with something different.
Check your honeypots manual or search online to find out how you can change it to something different.
