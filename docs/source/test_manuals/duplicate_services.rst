Duplicate services
==================

The target system is running two or more of the same service on different ports.

While we know you might want to attract traffic from malicious scripts with hardcoded port numbers, keep in mind that a more advanced attacker would easily tell this is not a real system.

Example: telnet services on ports 23, 223, 2233 would be an immediate red flag for a potential attacker
