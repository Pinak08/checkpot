Default website
===============

The webpage hosted by the target system is a perfect copy of the standard webpage for this honeypot.

This can make it easy to detect by the bad guys.

Check your honeypots manual or search online to find out how you can change it to something different.

**NOTE:** You can get creative and modify it to your liking or copy the default configuration of another system (e.g. the configuration page of a router) and see if it lures in any attackers.
