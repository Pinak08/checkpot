Default configuration template
==============================

Your ICS honeypot is using a default template probably including: default device name, default serial numbers, etc.

This can be a HUGE issue, tools like shodan's honeyscore will detect this in a short ammount of time.

Please check your honeypots manual or search online to find out how you can change it to something different.

**NOTE:** You can do your research and copy valid information from a real device to make it seem very realistic to the bad guys.

**NOTICE:** Also make sure you are not hosting your ICS honeypot on a popular VPS, that might also tip off the bad guys.
